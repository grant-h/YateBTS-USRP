# YateBTS N210

A YateBTS fork from the official SVN that still works with the USRP N210. Current versions of the MBTS only work with the bladeRF, which may not be available in your setup.
See https://hernan.de/blog/2020/08/04/creating-a-cellular-testbed-with-yatebts-and-srslte/ for the detailed setup instructions.
